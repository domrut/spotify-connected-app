# spotify-connected-app

Tech stack used:

React.js, Node.js, React Redux, React Router, Styled Components, Tailwind

Application allows the client to connect and authenticate with his Spotify account, search for albums/artists/playlists. Create playlists, allows to filter the songs from albums/playlists by BPM(Beats per minute) and create new playlists from the filtered/selected songs.

# How to install


Download files to any folder

Run `npm install` to install `node_modules` in both `front` and `back` folders

To run the node.js server run `nodemon server` in `/back` folder

To run react app type `run npm start` in `/front` folder

P.S. The application/authentication will not work, since the `.env` file is not present, and Spotify application is in development mode.
